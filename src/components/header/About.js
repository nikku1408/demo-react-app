              A remarkable about page is genuine, approachable, and
              distinguished. It should give the visitor a glimpse into what
              working with you might be like. You can include personal
              interests, stories, and photos that convey the unique story of
              your business. You may also include information about who’s on
              your team and what their roles are. About pages are personal to
              you and your company, so the structure of your about page will

              to building your about page.

        Hawk Tubley started his music career playing CBGB with the seminal noise
        band The Hæmorrhoids in New York City. Throughout the 1990s, he lived in
        Birmingham, Alabama, where his bands, including Eat More Possum, the
        Freeloaders, the Green Eggs and Partial To Mabel, played all over the
        Southeast and opened for such acts as Southern Culture on the Skids,
        Jason & The Scorchers, The Radiators, James Taylor and David Allen Coe.
        His band Partial To Mabel was voted "Best Folk Acoustic Band" in
        Birmingham. Since moving to Philadelphia, Hawk Tubley (with the help of
        several world-famous musicians) released a CD of his own material called
        Cooking With Dynamite!, which Tri-State Indie calls "a solid 40 minutes
        of country, bluegrass, and rock and roll riding the edge of rhyme and
        reason - the kind of barnyard shenanigans and slapstick sing-a-longs
        that can pull you out of that puddle of mud." The album features songs
        about trucks, trains and elephants, and includes a five-part a cappella
        tune on the virtues of regular flossing. In 2017, Hawk Tubley & The
        Ozymandians - Andres Villamil on bass, Mike “Luxor” Szekely on drums,
        and Andy “Major Headspin” Davis on the electric guitar - released a new
        album, Pond Kings In April, a genre-bending mix of indie rock, cowboy
        folk and good old-fashioned rock ‘n’ roll, featuring exceptional
        songwriting and Hawk Tubley’s distinctive voice. While Hawk Tubley has
        been compared to musicians as diverse as Captain Beefheart, Robyn
        Hitchcock and the Fugs, perhaps the most oddly apt testimonial came from
        New Jersey blues legend Barbecue Bob Pomeroy, who, describing Hawk's
        Cooking With Dynamite!, said, "This record is great! I feel like I'm at
        a yard sale at Howard Finster's house."
